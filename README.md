### Overview

For this project, I used the GIPHY API to create a dynamic web page that populates with TV-related gifs. I called the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site. Users can input their own topics using a dynamic button +  gifs related to the topic will render on the page.
